"The rapid digitalisation of healthcare services has led to an exponential increase in unstructured textual data such as clinical notes, discharge summaries, and patient histories. These documents often contain vital information relevant to diagnosis, treatment planning, and specialist referrals. However, their free-text nature poses a significant challenge for automated processing, especially in tasks like medical document classification. Accurate classification of clinical transcriptions by medical specialty (e.g. cardiology, neurology, or orthopaedics) not only improves data organisation but also supports downstream applications like triage automation, billing, and decision support systems.
This project investigates and compares multiple approaches to the task of multi-class classification of medical transcriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The chosen dataset consists of nearly 5,000 real-world medical transcription records across 40 different specialties. Each record is a full transcription of a clinical encounter, and the goal is to correctly predict the specialty associated with each note.
Four types of models are explored to evaluate different algorithmic paradigms: two traditional machine learning methods — Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) — and two deep learning approaches — a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a custom-built Transformer-based architecture. These models are implemented, refined, and evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score. Special attention is paid to class imbalance, which poses a significant challenge given the distribution of specialties in the dataset.
The other parts of this report outline the literature context for this task, the data and preprocessing techniques applied, the design and training of the models, and a comprehensive evaluation of results. Through this exploration, the report aims to identify not only the most effective model for the given task but also the challenges and opportunities that arise in clinical NLP tasks involving complex, imbalanced, multi-class data.
